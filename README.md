Finding relevant Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) jobs can be frustrating. Many job boards lack proper filtering, forcing engineers to sift through irrelevant roles. That’s why I built NewSREJobs.com — a focused job board that lists the latest SRE openings with a simple technology filter to surface roles that actually match your skillset.

NewSREJobs pulls in new listings regularly and offers a clean, distraction-free interface for quickly browsing opportunities. While most postings don’t include detailed filters like tech stacks or cloud providers, I added a lightweight filtering tool so you can quickly isolate jobs mentioning AWS, Kubernetes, GCP, Terraform, and other relevant technologies.

Whether you’re actively job hunting or just keeping an eye on the market, NewSREJobs is designed to save you time and help you find roles that match your expertise. Check it out and let us know what features you’d like to see next:
